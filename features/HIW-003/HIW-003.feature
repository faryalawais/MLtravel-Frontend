Feature: How It Works (HIW-003)

  # AC-12: motion validated in separate *-motion.spec.ts — not inline in @fe scenarios (slice grill-me S3)
  # AC-13: token lint enforced by npm run gate — not a UI scenario
  # AC-14: health endpoint — LP-001 GH#2 @be — not duplicated for HIW-003
  # GitHub issues #18–#25 · PRD v2 approved 2026-07-06
  # Every @fe slice: 1440px + 393px Figma match where applicable (slice grill-me S2)
  # Page flow: Navbar → Hero → Steps → Mid CTA → Six-week → (Testimonial → Benefits, mobile) → Final CTA → FAQ → Footer

  # ── FE scenarios (1:1 with vertical slice issues) ─────────────────────────
